Image Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography comes from Greek steganographia, which combines the words stegan√≥s, meaning "covered or concealed", and -graphia meaning "writing".

Steganography can be used to conceal almost any type of digital content, including text, image, video or audio content. The data to be hidden can be hidden inside any type of digital file. The content to be concealed through steganography, called hidden text is often encrypted before being incorporated into the innocuous-seeming cover text file or data stream. If not encrypted, the hidden text is commonly processed in some way in order to increase the difficulty of detecting the secret content.

Steganography comprises of three components:

1. Carrier (Image, Video, MP3 file, etc)
2. Message (Hidden text to be transfered)
3. Key (Password, pattern, etc)
